     The competitive rules for the FragZone BGMISCRIM App revolve around four core principles, beginning with a Zero Tolerance for Cheating policy that strictly forbids the use of any unauthorized third-party software, hacks, or modifications, including but not limited to Aimbots and Wallhacks; any account found cheating will be permanently banned from the platform, resulting in the immediate disqualification of the entire associated squad from the current event and revocation of all future  invites. Maintaining Fair Play and Sportsmanship is equally crucial, requiring all players to uphold respect towards opponents and staff, and prohibiting any form of verbal abuse, harassment, discrimination, or intentional sabotage of team efforts (Griefing/Intentional Feeding). To ensure Match Integrity and Technical Rules are met, players are individually responsible for their stable internet connection and device performance—matches will generally not be paused or restarted for personal technical issues—and squads must confirm Lobby Readiness 10 minutes before the scheduled match time, with only authorized Admins and Casters permitted to spectate. Penalties for violations are scaled by severity, ranging from a Warning for minor infractions, to Map Forfeiture for issues like missing the ready check, and escalating to Full Disqualification or a Permanent Ban for serious breaches of integrity; finally, Admins retain the final authority to interpret these rules and apply all necessary penalties to safeguard competitive integrity.
